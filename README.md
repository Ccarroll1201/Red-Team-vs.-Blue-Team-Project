# Red-Team-vs.-Blue-Team-Project

### Red Team
In this exercise, I attacked a vulnerable network using a variety of different tools on a Kali Linux VM.  After multiple steps (outlined within the repositories main document), I was able to gain full root access to the system and capture the flag hidden within the target organizations network.

### Blue Team
After successfully penetrating the target organizations network, I reversed roles and took a detailed look at the attack from the perspective of a security analyst.  The data from my attack was captured and forwarded to Kibana where I was able to sift through the data to isolate evidence left behind from each step I took when attacking on the Kali machine.  I then took all this information and devised strategies outlining how these attacks could have been prevented.
